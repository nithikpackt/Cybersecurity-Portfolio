### Analysis

The core issue is that the DNS server is not responding to UDP requests on port 53. This is indicated by the "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP error messages. This means that DNS resolution is failing, which is preventing users from accessing the website.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

# Identify the Affected Protocol:

The error message "udp port 53 unreachable" clearly indicates that the UDP protocol is affected. Specifically, the DNS protocol, which relies on UDP for queries, is failing. Identify the Affected Service:

Port 53 is the standard port for the Domain Name System (DNS) service. Therefore, the DNS service is the affected service. Analyze the tcpdump Log (Example based on the description):

Here's a representation of what the tcpdump log might looks like (with example timestamps and IPs):
```
13:24:32.192571 192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain: 35084+ A? www.yummyrecipesforme.com.
13:24:32.192650 192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain: 35084+ A? www.yummyrecipesforme.com.
13:24:32.193000 203.0.113.2 > 192.51.100.15: ICMP 203.0.113.2 unreachable - udp port 53 unreachable
13:24:32.193050 203.0.113.2 > 192.51.100.15: ICMP 203.0.113.2 unreachable - udp port 53 unreachable
13:24:33.194571 192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain: 35085+ A? www.yummyrecipesforme.com.
13:24:33.195000 203.0.113.2 > 192.51.100.15: ICMP 203.0.113.2 unreachable - udp port 53 unreachable
```
Explanation:
The first two lines show your computer (192.51.100.15) sending UDP queries to the DNS server (203.0.113.2) on port 53.
The following lines show the DNS server responding with ICMP error messages, indicating that UDP port 53 is unreachable.
The process is repeated.
Write a Follow-Up Report:

Subject: DNS Resolution Incident - www.yummyrecipesforme.com

## Executive Summary:

This report details an incident where users were unable to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com due to DNS resolution failures.
The issue was identified as the DNS server (203.0.113.2) not responding to UDP requests on port 53, resulting in "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP errors.
Incident Details:

Time of Incident: Starting at approximately 13:24:32 (1:24 PM)
Affected Service: Domain Name System (DNS)
Affected Protocol: UDP
Observed Behavior:
* Users received "destination port unreachable" errors when attempting to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com.
* Network analysis using tcpdump revealed that UDP packets sent to the DNS server on port 53 were met with ICMP "udp port 53 unreachable" error messages.
* This indicates that the DNS service was not listening or responding on the expected port.
* The problem repeated several times.
  
# Root Cause:

Possible causes include:
* DNS server service failure.
* Firewall or network configuration issues blocking UDP port 53.
* DNS server overload.
* Malicious attack, most likely a DDOS attack on the DNS server
  
# Recommendations:

Security engineers should investigate the root cause of the DNS server's failure to respond on UDP port 53.
Implement appropriate measures to prevent recurrence, such as monitoring DNS server health and reviewing firewall configurations.
Inform all clients that were affected by this issue.
